\# AQI Predictor



This repository contains:



\- Feature pipeline: fetches and prepares AQI data hourly

\- Training pipeline: trains ML models daily

\- Backfill pipeline: backfills 1 month of AQI data



\## 🔬 Advanced Analytics Features

This system goes beyond simple prediction by implementing:

\* \*\*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\*\* Interactive correlation studies between humidity, temperature, and AQI levels.

\* \*\*Model Explainability:\*\* Identifies Top Impact Factors (Feature Importance) to explain AI decision-making.

\* \*\*Public Health Alerts:\*\* Automated hazard detection system for AQI spikes > 150.

\* \*\*Multi-Model Support:\*\* Architecture designed to support both Statistical Regressors and Deep Learning models via a decoupled inference pipeline.
